The script explore a directory and returns duplicate files with their path.
You just need to input a path to a folder (like "C:\Users\HFLabs\Downloads")
after launching and program will show duplicate file

* C:\Users\HFLabs\Downloads
* ('oraocci12d.dll', 'size = 1125888')
* ('Address_REG_CLEANED_28042017.qvw', 'size = 32453632')
* ('oraocci12.dll', 'size = 1099264')
* ('asbs_all_client_final_fullfill_score.txt', 'size = 1441')
* ('cvuhelper121.jar', 'size = 824883')
* ('oraocci12.sym', 'size = 843632')
* ('Address_LIVING_CLEANED_03052017.txt', 'size = 336168345')
* ('cvuhelper102.jar', 'size = 34337')
* ('Address_REG_CLEANED_28042017.txt', 'size = 218664359')
